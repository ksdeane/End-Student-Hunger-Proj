    <h1>Take Action!</h1>

    <h3>You can aid in the fight against childhood hunger, even by doing something small</h3>

    <h1 class="smaller">What you can do:</h1>


  <body style="background-color: rgb(3, 19, 37)>

      <div class="action">
        <h3>Fundraise</h3>
        <p>You can either participate in an existing fundraiser or raise money to feed hungry kids on your own. Some ideas for starting your own fundraisers are...</p>
        <p>- Bake sale: sell baked goods to members of your community</p>
        <p>- Birthdays: ask family and friends for donations to support hungry kids in place of gifts</p>
        <p>- Athletic event: host a walk-a-thon and ask your community to sponsor the walkers, or offer an event such as a dance class that people can attend by donating</p>
      </div>


      <div class="action">
        <h3>Donate</h3>
        <p>If you have money you would like to go towards feeding families in need, consider <a href="https://secure.feedingamerica.org/site/Donation2;jsessionid=00000000.app206b?idb=483284701&df_id=26876&26876.donation=form1&mfc_pref=T&NONCE_TOKEN=3AF599D8CDAA5C543F0969E82B6FD005&s_subsrc=circle&s_src=W212XGOLE&utm_campaign=circle&utm_source=earned&utm_content=circle&26876_donation=form1&utm_medium=partner&utm_term=gift">donating to Feeding America</a>. 99% of donations to Feeding America go directly to their programs devoted to ending hunger.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="action">
        <h3>Volunteer</h3>
        <p>This one may seem simple, and that's because it is! Volunteering at a food bank, food pantry, or soup kitchen is a great way to directly help hungry kids and their families. The easiest way to find a place to volunteer is by searching "food bank near me" or "soup kitchen near me" and contacting someone at the organization about lending a hand.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="action">
        <h3>Collect Resources</h3>
        <p>You can hold regular food drives and ask your community to provide meal items for hungry kids; then make the food accessible to the kids who need it! This is especially helpful during the summertime, when kids who rely on school meals are most vulnerable.</p>
      </div>
    
      <div class="action">
        <h3>Speak Up</h3>
        <p>You can get more people involved in ending student hunger by advocating for the cause. This could be as simple as talking to family and friends, or you could take an extra step and reach out to the leaders in your community.</p>
        <p>- Start a Letter Writing Campaign: Send a letter to your local legislator or school administrator and ask them toÂ make student hunger a priority in your district. These <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/mnusn2ud3yse2lh/AADiNXhVcesrHDBbp9MSG3zEa?dl=0">advocacy letter templates</a> by No Kid Hungry are helpful.</p>
        <p>- Schedule a Meeting with Your Local Elected Officials: Food insecurity rates are extremely high across the nation, so now is a good time to reach out to your local elected officials and let them know of the importance of addressing hunger in your community. No Kid Hungry also offers a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/u6ve7j4t1lqknin/How%20to%20Schedule%20a%20Meeting%20with%20Your%20Local%20Elected%20Officials.docx?dl=0">guide on how to contact your elected officials</a>.</p>
